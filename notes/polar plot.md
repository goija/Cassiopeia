 ≈ 4 × depth of a stair tread ( ≈ 11 in )
  ≈ 0.76 × wavelength of sound at a frequency of 1 kHz in water ( ≈ 1.5 m )
   ≈ 0.76 × wavelength of sound at a frequency of 1 kHz in water ( ≈ 1.5 m )

   The wavelength of a 1-kHz sound traveling in water would be 150 cm. Explanation:This is because in the equation, v(velocity) = 1500 m/s, and f (frequency) = 1 kHz


   To calculate the wavelength (λλ) of a sound wave traveling in water, we use the wave equation:
v=f⋅λ
v=f⋅λ

Where:

    vv is the speed of sound in the medium (water in this case),
    ff is the frequency of the sound wave,
    λλ is the wavelength.

    Substitution:
λ=1500 m/s1000 Hz=1.5 m
λ=1000Hz1500m/s​=1.5m

Convert λλ to centimeters:
1.5 m=150 cm
1.5m=150cm
Conclusion:

The wavelength of a 1-kHz sound traveling in water is 150 cm. This calculation is correct based on the provided values of vv and ff.

o calculate 0.76×wavelength of sound at 1 kHz in water0.76×wavelength of sound at 1 kHz in water:
Step 1: Wavelength of Sound in Water

We already know that:
λ=vf
λ=fv​

where v=1500 m/sv=1500m/s and f=1 kHz=1000 Hzf=1kHz=1000Hz.
λ=15001000=1.5 m=150 cm.
λ=10001500​=1.5m=150cm.
Step 2: Multiply by 0.76
0.76×150 cm=114 cm.
0.76×150cm=114cm.
Final Answer:

The result is 114 cm.
